Explanation

flipper.css is for the flipping things in fundraise.html basically the front element is rotated 0deg, back is 180deg. Then when you hover over either the front one goes to 180deg, and back goes to 0 deg. look at the code to see more

Just Dream is just a font
i used a little js but not much its pretty unimportant

ok thats it
